Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different models for analysis the Skin Cancer HAM1000 dataset with DeepCNN using different optimization and activation function, 

So we further enhance the performance by exploring Prediction techniques using Xception and DenseNet for analysis the dataset, which may get 90% of accuracy or above,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
